# Lena Editor
A cross-platform editor with the primary focus of V programming.

## Dependencies
Install the required modules from the `v.mod` with: `v install` while inside
the repository root. Sometimes the `v install` command does not work correctly.
If it does not work, then you'll need to clone each item in the `dependencies`
array inside of `v.mod` to `$home/.vmodules/` manually.

### Debian / Ubuntu
* `sudo apt install libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libgl-dev`
